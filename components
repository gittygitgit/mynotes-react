Itâ€™s one of just many UI solutions built around components.



Pages are broken down into components

A page is composed of components, with components in turn built on top of other components

	componentDidMount
		Invoked automatically after component has been rendered for first time


	setState
		should be invoked whenever component should be rerendered

		Framework automatically rerenders components when this is called






React.createClass
