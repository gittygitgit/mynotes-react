Difference between props and state

State is needed as a triggering factor to getting new data / state into the system.

Properties are injected in a top-down manner.

	They are read-only data which represents a given state.

State changes trigger re-renders

during re-renders, new properties can be assigned to component properties




State
	mutable

	private to the component and modified by calling setState

	changes to state cause the component to re-render

	render is written as a function of this.props and this.state
