createClass
Creates a Component class given a specification

Specification has a render property that returns something which will eventually resolve to html.

Doesnâ€™t necesarily include html.

May contain jsx, html, or a mixture of both

react knows how to differentiate between react jsx markup and pure html

within createClass specification, this refers to the instance.

Allows escape hatch out of react model

ReactComponent render(
  ReactElement element,
  DOMElement container,
  [function callback]
)

Controls the content of passed in container

If dom already exists in container, react updates the element using react diffing algorithm.
